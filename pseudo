/////////////FIX GROUPS///////////////
Logout

Need render via state:
Create Group
Delete Group
Make delete group api call in page: groups.js // instead of component: groupscomp

//
Why is Link not working in addressgrouplist? Have to use redirect?
//
After saving a group, the page needs to be refreshed before group will populate and sometimes doesn't populate until you create an additional group.
It's like it's one step behind.
