// WORKS //
== ADD CONTACT

// NEEDS WORK //

== GROUPS
Create group name - hitting route, logging group, but receiving error:
    "Group.groupName cannot be null"

== EVENTS
Add new event - hitting route, logging event data but receiving error:
    "eventDb.addEvent is not a function"
















/////////////FIX GROUPS///////////////
Logout

Need render via state:
Create Group
Delete Group
Make delete group api call in page: groups.js // instead of component: groupscomp

//
Why is Link not working in addressgrouplist? Have to use redirect?
//
After saving a group, the page needs to be refreshed before group will populate and sometimes doesn't populate until you create an additional group.
It's like it's one step behind.
