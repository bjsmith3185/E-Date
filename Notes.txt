How to do an update (put) = ID and body? or just body?

-Group and GroupWithContacts share groupName in model
    -With foreign key does the same groupName translate to both tables?




Logic Notes

* Contact can be created with or without a group.
* Contact can belong to multiple groups.
* Group can be created without and contacts.
* New Contact and new Group can be created in the same request.
* If a Contact is removed it must also be removed from all associated Groups.
* Group can be deleted without deleting the Contact.
